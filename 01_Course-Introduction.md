- Configure the deployment with ConfigMaps, Secrets, and SecurityContexts.
- Understand multi-container Pod design.
- Configure probes for Pod health.
- Update and roll back an application.
- Implement services and NetworkPolicies.
- Use PersistentVolumeClaims for state persistence.
 
You should expect to spend approximately 35 hours to complete this course. You have unlimited access to the content for 12 months from the date you registered, even after you have completed the course.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, you can always go back, thread your own path through the material, and return to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

## **Who is the course for?**
This course is designed for developers looking to learn how to deploy, configure, and test their containerized applications on a multi-node Kubernetes cluster.

## **What the course prepares you for?**
This course will teach you how to containerize, host, deploy, and configure an application in a multi-node cluster. Starting with a simple Python script, you will define application resources and use core primitives to build, monitor and troubleshoot scalable applications in Kubernetes. Working with network plugins, security and cloud storage, you will be exposed to many of the features needed to deploy an application in a production environment.

The course, along with real-world experience and study, will provide the skills and knowledge also tested by the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam.
